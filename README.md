End-to-end analysis of social media addiction using Power BI and linear regression.

## Overview
This project analyzes a social media addiction dataset using two approaches:
data visualization with Power BI and predictive modeling with linear regression.

Working on both approaches helped me clearly understand the difference between
exploring data visually and analyzing it mathematically.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following attributes:
- Country
- Age
- Sleep hours
- Mental health indicators
- Academic impact
- Social media addiction score

The same dataset was used across both visualization and modeling stages.

## What I Observed Using Power BI
Power BI helped me explore and understand the data visually.

Through dashboards, charts, and slicers, I was able to:
- Identify patterns across countries and age groups
- Compare addiction scores interactively
- Observe relationships between sleep hours and addiction
- Understand trends related to academic and mental health impact

Power BI mainly helped answer questions like:
- What is happening in the data?
- How do values differ across groups?

## What I Observed Using Linear Regression
Linear regression helped me move from observation to prediction.

By building a regression model, I was able to:
- Quantify relationships between variables
- Predict social media addiction scores
- Evaluate model performance using metrics
- Understand how different features contribute to predictions

Linear regression mainly helped answer questions like:
- How much does one factor influence addiction?
- Can addiction scores be predicted using available features?

## Key Difference I Learned
From this project, I learned that:
- Power BI is useful for exploring and understanding patterns in data
- Linear regression is useful for explaining relationships and making predictions

In simple terms:
Power BI shows what is happening,
while linear regression explains why and how much.

## Linear Regression Performance
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): ~0.16
- R² Score: ~0.93

These results indicate strong predictive performance on unseen data.

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand:
- The transition from data visualization to predictive modeling
- How exploratory analysis supports better modeling decisions
- The importance of one-hot encoding for categorical data
- How to evaluate regression models using MSE and R²
